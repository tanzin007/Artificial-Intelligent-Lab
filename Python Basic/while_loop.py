# while loop is used to execute a block of statements repeatedly until a given condition is satisfied. 
# And when the condition becomes false, the line immediately after the loop in the program is executed.

# Python program to illustrate while loop :
count = 0
while (count < 3):    
    count = count + 1
    print("Hello Geek")

print("while loop ended")
