# Lists are just like arrays, declared in other languages which is an ordered collection of data. 
# It is very flexible as the items in a list do not need to be of the same type.

# Lists in Python can be created by just placing the sequence inside the square brackets[].


# Python program to demonstrate  
# Creation of List  
  
# Creating a List 
List = [] 
print("Initial blank List: ") 
print(List) 
  
# Creating a List with  
# the use of a String 
List = ['GeeksForGeeks'] 
print("\nList with the use of String: ") 
print(List) 
  
# Creating a List with 
# the use of multiple values 
List = ["Geeks", "For", "Geeks"] 
print("\nList containing multiple values: ") 
print(List[0])  
print(List[2]) 
  
# Creating a Multi-Dimensional List 
# (By Nesting a list inside a List) 
List = [['Geeks', 'For'], ['Geeks']] 
print("\nMulti-Dimensional List: ") 
print(List)
